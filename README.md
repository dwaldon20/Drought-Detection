# Drought-Detection
Climate change affects our weather, which in turn impacts many people and industries in different ways. People who are particularly susceptible to weather changes can use technology to help monitor and predict weather situations that can negatively affect their businesses or livelihoods. In this lab, we are going to look at the beginnings of how you can write programs to analyze weather data to compute basic statistics--numerical summaries that are the foundation of predictive models.

Here, we are going to focus on rainfall and drought conditions, which influence many communities in different ways. This assignment is driven by real-world weather data collected from weather observation stations.
